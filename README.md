## CV

This is an academic CV of Niko Partanen. It doesn't contain information about my software development work, layout design work or involment in different NGO's, mainly in relation to Uralic languages and peoples. I have also participated in different voluntary work in different periods of my life. The academic CV here may be customized regularly depending where it is needed, and I'm thinking of playing with GitHub releases, so that each finalized and sent version would be archived as it's own version that way. Otherwise the document is continuously living as new publications, presentations, teaching etc. are added.

This CV is based on template of Kieran Healy, which can be found [here](http://kjhealy.github.io/kjh-vita/).
