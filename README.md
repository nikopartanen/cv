## CV

This is an academic CV of Niko Partanen. Both [English](https://github.com/nikopartanen/cv/blob/master/niko_partanen_cv.pdf) and [Finnish](https://github.com/nikopartanen/cv/blob/master/niko_partanen_cv_fin.pdf) versions are available.

As a merely academic CV, this version doesn't contain information about my software development work, layout design work or involment in different NGO's, mainly in relation to Uralic languages and peoples. I have also participated in different voluntary work in different periods of my life. I'm happy to share more information and references for these activities if needed.  The documents in this repository are continuously living as new publications, presentations, teaching etc. are added.

This CV is based on template of Kieran Healy, which can be found [here](http://kjhealy.github.io/kjh-vita/).
